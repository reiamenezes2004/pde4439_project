Final Project Title:
Salik SmartRewards – An Emotion-Aware Robotic Reward Redemption System for Toll Users

Final Project Concept (What It Is):
You are building a robotics-integrated kiosk designed to let frequent Salik users redeem loyalty rewards based on their toll usage. The kiosk combines a mobile app interface with embedded hardware to simulate a real-world smart rewards system. It integrates QR-based point validation, fingerprint authentication, emotional awareness, and robotic interaction feedback, offering users a secure and human-centric redemption experience.

Final Feature List (Confirmed)

SOFTWARE + APP FEATURES (iPad-based GUI)
- User login + dashboard (enter username, view points)
- QR code scanner using iPad rear camera
- Real-time validation of points from a simulated CSV
- Emotion detection via camera (DeepFace / FER)
- Adaptive voice response using offline TTS
- Transaction logging system with timestamped entries

HARDWARE + ROBOTIC FEATURES (Arduino-controlled)
- Fingerprint verification via R307 sensor
- Reward dispensing mechanism using servo motor
- Multi-color LED interaction mapping:
  - Blue = QR scanning
  - Yellow = Awaiting fingerprint
  - Green = Success
  - Red = Error / Mismatch
- Secure reward compartment (with servo lock)
- IR or ultrasonic sensor for presence or hand detection (optional)
- Admin maintenance QR access for diagnostic and restock mode

Robotics Value & Justification:
This project goes beyond automation and enters robotic system territory through:
- Human-Robot Interaction (emotion detection + voice + LEDs)
- Multi-modal sensing (camera, fingerprint, optional IR)
- State-based robotic behavior (LEDs, servo control, condition-based logic)
- Secure, adaptive dispensing logic (based on points, interaction)

What You'll Demonstrate in the Final Demo:
1. User logs in via iPad GUI and sees their points.
2. They scan a QR code (camera).
3. The system detects their emotion → speaks a relevant message.
4. QR gets validated → fingerprint prompt appears.
5. LED changes throughout process (visual feedback).
6. If fingerprint matches → reward is dispensed via servo into a tray.
7. All data is logged (user, points used, timestamp, emotion).

This is not just a reward machine. It’s an emotionally aware, sensor-integrated, multi-modal robotic kiosk — designed for public deployment, commercial scalability, and future extensions into smart city systems.
